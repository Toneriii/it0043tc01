                The Raiden Shogun (Japanese: 雷らい電でん将しょう軍ぐん Raiden Shougun) The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity — a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma.
                <br>
                The Raiden Shogun is comprised of two beings in one body: Ei, the current Electro Archon of Inazuma; and the Shogun, the puppet created by Ei to act as the ruler of Inazuma in her stead.

                Kamisato Ayaka (Japanese: 神かみ里さと綾あや華か Kamisato Ayaka) Ayaka is a kind-hearted girl with a pleasant temperament who treats others with politeness and courtesy. She holds the people of Inazuma dear to her heart and often goes out of her way to personally assist in all kinds of matters; being a member of the Yashiro Commission, she feels that she must meet the people's needs.
                <br>
                She is in charge of the internal and external affairs of the Kamisato Clan and is the younger sister of Kamisato Ayato. Beautiful, dignified, and noble, Ayaka has earned the title Shirasagi Himegimi and is considered a model of perfection in Inazuma.

                Arataki Itto (Japanese: 荒あら瀧たき一いっ斗と Arataki Itto) Despite appearing as "mean and overbearing," Itto is a kind soul at heart, apart from trying to pick a fight with Kujou Sara at every possible opportunity. He is not particularly intelligent, but can put in the effort when asked of him. He is respected by his gang and mostly liked by Inazuma City's people, especially children, but is at odds with the Tenryou Commission despite his mostly harmless antics and pranks.
                <br>
                A loud and proud descendant of the crimson oni, Itto is also the leader and founder of the Arataki Gang. While not a villain, his reputation as a delinquent in Inazuma City leaves something to be desired.

                Sayu (Japanese: 早さ柚ゆ Sayu) Sayu is a seemingly eternally sleep-deprived ninja who uses her skills to hide from work and responsibilities. Her height is something she's deeply unsatisfied with, believing that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller. In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.
                <br>
                A ninja from the Shuumatsuban that is struggling with growing tall. Sayu believes that sleeping can help her growth, which is why she prefers to use her ninja techniques to hide and "laze around."

She is also loved by children due to her friendly hands-on approach with them, as she wishes to keep them happy so they don't have to deal with the harsh realities of Inazuma for the time being. Having very few worries of her own, she can also read peoples' hearts and can tell whether or not they're hiding something deep down.
                <br>
                Yoimiya is the current owner of Naganohara Fireworks; with her colorful fireworks and outgoing personality, Yoimiya is loved by everyone on Narukami Island. She was coined as the "Queen of the Summer Festival," as they believe summer is not the same without her.
